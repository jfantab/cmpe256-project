Our final project was on the [Million Songs dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Listed below are the links to the respective datasets we used.

Link to the [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/msdchallenge/data).

1. [Taste Profile Subset](http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile/) | [Train data](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip) 
- Note: These train and test files exceed Github's max file size limit, so the links are provided here for download.
2. [MusixMatch Data](http://millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch/) | [Train split](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/mxm_dataset_train.txt.zip) | [Test split](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/mxm_dataset_test.txt.zip)
- Note: The train and test split is arbitrary, both files can be combined to get the full coverage of lyrics for all the songs. These zip files are already included in the repository.
3. [TagTraum Genre Annotations](http://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html) | [Data link](https://www.tagtraum.com/genres/msd_tagtraum_cd1.cls.zip)
- Note: These zip files are already included in the repository.

The required libraries used in the preprocessing can be downloaded with the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. The preprocessing notebooks are made so that the file structure and necessary files can be downloaded and reconstructed.
